# Calculus-Integrals [![View <File Exchange Title> on File Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/images/matlab-file-exchange.svg)](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/105740-calculus-integrals)
**Curriculum Module**  
_Created with R2021b. Compatible with R2021b and later releases._  

## Description ##
This curriculum module contains interactive [live scripts](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/live-editor.html) and a [MATLAB&reg; app](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/app-designer.html) that teach basic concepts of integral calculus. There is a focus on numerical approximation and graphical representation as tools for understanding the concepts of integral calculus.

Calculus-Integrals covers Riemann sum approximations to definite integrals, indefinite integrals as antiderivatives, and the fundamental theorem of calculus. It also covers the indefinite integrals of powers, exponentials, natural logarithms, sines and cosines as well as substitution and integration by parts. Applications include area and power. 

These live scripts can be used as part of a lecture, as activities in an instructional setting, or as interactive assignments to be completed outside of class. The module is divided into three folders with the same content offered for different use: [Full Scripts](#fullscripts-folder), [Visualizations](#visualizations-folder), and [Practice](#practice-folder).

Opening `Integrals.prj` will add the module to your MATLAB path and open a navigation page where you can choose interactive examples by topic or type. The instructions inside the live scripts will guide you through the exercises and activities. Get started with each live script by running it one section at a time. To stop running the script or a section midway (for example, when an animation is in progress), use the Stop button in the RUN section of the Live Editor tab in the MATLAB Toolstrip.

## Prerequisite Domain Knowledge ##
This module assumes a knowledge of functions that is standard in precalculus course materials regarding powers, exponentials, absolute values, logarithms, sines, cosines, rational functions, and asymptotes. It also assumes knowledge of basic area formulas, including the area of a trapezoid. With the exception of integralRiemann.mlx and vizRiemann.mlx, the scripts are written to follow [Calculus-Derivatives](https://github.com/MathWorks-Teaching-Resources/Calculus-Derivatives) and expect basic understanding of derivatives and derivative rules.

## Suggested Prework ##
Minimal use of MATLAB syntax is required to complete some of the interactive practice, but it is all reviewed in the scripts themselves as needed. If you wish a more complete introduction to MATLAB, you can take
[MATLAB Onramp](https://www.mathworks.com/learn/tutorials/matlab-onramp.html) â€“ a free two-hour introductory tutorial that teaches the essentials of MATLAB.<br>

## Visualizations Folder ## 
This folder includes scripts for the visualization examples alone, as you might use them in a lecture or class demonstration.

## ##
**`vizRiemann.mlx`**
An interactive script presenting visualizations of approximating the area under a user-defined curve by a user-defined number of rectangular or trapezoidal components as well as options to picture the error in each approximation. The only addition to this set of examples is the option to use a randomly selected point in each interval to determine the height of the rectangular approximation. This only makes sense in the context of an area defined by a function rather than by data, but could be useful for discussing why we generally just stick with interval endpoints. 

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88841524/150543083-249fa442-b709-46df-b997-48c77017d011.png" width="500">

**Learning Goals:**
- Be able to sketch the graphical interpretation of geometric approximations to areas defined by curves and be able to explain why particular methods and particular curves result in especially good (or bad) approximations.
- Explain why increasing the number of intervals in an approximation will decrease the error.

## ##
**`vizFundamentalTheorem.mlx`** 
An interactive script presenting geometric interpretations of both the integral and derivative forms of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, applied to user-defined functions. 

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88841524/150543100-4a69ad94-9830-4db4-a85d-9fe03baa30b8.png" width="500">

**Learning Goals:**
- Be able to explain why the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus makes sense graphically.

## ##
**`vizSubstitution.mlx`**
An interactive script presenting visualizations displaying the different curves generated by plotting f(g(x)) against g(x) or against x, as well as exploring the impact of using a step of dx or a step of dg = g'(x)dx to traverse the region of interest. The animation code geometrically demonstrates some of the potential savings by showing a default example where the dx integral adds and subtracts a region that the dg integral entirely ignores.

**Learning Goals:**
- Graphical understanding of the method of substitution. 

## ##
**`vizByParts.mlx`**
An interactive script presenting a geometric understanding of integration by parts. The default values generate a classic visualization of a definite integration by parts, but the code is designed to allow investigation of more complicated functions as well by allowing the separation of the resulting image into positive and negative regions with respect to each variable as well as showing or hiding the lines depicting the standard intervals for each variable.

## Practice Folder ##
This folder includes scripts that are purely directed at student practice, as you might assign for homework or use for understanding checks during class or offer to students to help them study for an exam. 

## ##
**`CalculusFlashcards.mlapp`**
A MATLAB app that allows the user to select among four different categories of derivative practice (simple derivatives, linear combinations of powers, product rule, and chain rule) or integral practice (simple integrals, definite integrals, substitution, and integration by parts) or any combination thereof. Variables can be restricted to x and t or varied randomly over a larger set of options. The solutions can be displayed immediately or multiple attempts at each problem can be recorded. Results are tracked by type of problem including correct solutions, incorrect solutions, and problems which are not even attempted before generating a new one. Some constructive feedback for common errors is automatically generated.
